# Java JSON Parsing Exercise

This is a simple practice on how i learn to write a proper JSON formats, and reading it back

There are  3 json files that i created here.. they are:

  - simple.json (just put a simple object on it)
  - middle.json (contains JSONArray)
  - hard.json (contains JSONArray that contains Map lol)

This very simple project is using 'json-simple' from maven repository
